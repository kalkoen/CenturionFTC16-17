# Centurion - EU0076 - FTC Robot Controller App (ftc_app)
FTC Android Studio project with custom code by award-winning FTC Team Centurion.
This code was written during the 2016-2017 season for the game Velocity Vortex and was used 20th May 2017 at the FTC Dutch Open.

Due to problems we've experienced during this season, this project had to be rebuilt several times, causing all commits to be lost.
